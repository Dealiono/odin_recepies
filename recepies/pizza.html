            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
                    <li>1 pound pizza dough</li>
                    <li>2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
                    <li>1 cup shredded smoked cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup diced red onion</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly coat a baking sheet or pizza pan with olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Working on a surface that has been sprinkled with cornmeal, roll out the pizza into a 12-inch-diameter round. Transfer to prepared baking sheet or pizza pan.</li>
                    <li>Using a small ladle, spread bbq sauce over the surface of the dough in an even layer, leaving a 1/2-inch border.</li>
                    <li>Top with chicken, cheeses and onion; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
                    <li>Place into oven and bake for 20-24 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheeses have melted.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately, garnished with cilantro, if desired.</li>
                </ol>
